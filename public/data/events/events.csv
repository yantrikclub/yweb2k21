events;Zirka;../data/events/zirka.jpg;Zirka was a 3 weeks long event conducted during break time. Professors from various institutes were asked to put forth an engineering problem which was given to the participants to solve. The problem statement revolved mostly around mathematics and physics challenges and in certain cases creating models to best simulate a situation to get the most optimal result. However, the event had to be later withdrawn due to the higher difficulty of the problem statements and not so attractive winning prize.;1,,,,,,,
events;Junkyard Wars;../data/events/junkyardwars.jpg; This is one of the memorable event of the club. Students were asked to show their creativity by transforming the junk to some useful machines. Those marvelous transformations are memorable to students as they added value to the junk and make them useful once again.;0,,,,,,,,
events;Quizzes;../data/events/quiz.jpg;Dodging the inability to conduct hands-on sessions during the online semester, the Yantrik club decided to conduct quizzes. Some of these were Euces, Conveyance, Corinthian;1,,,,,
events;Water Rocket;../data/events/waterrocket.jpg;In this event, the participants had to create a water rocket using plastic bottles and a compressor. This event was conducted a few years back and involves much more learning than just making a basic rocket. For example, the creation of a nozzle or how the amount of water put in the bottle affects the distance covered.;0,,,,,,
events;Modelling Challenge;../data/events/modellingchallenge.jpg;The Yantrik club conducts 3D modeling challenges which are generally based on two types of problem statements - one of them involves making a model under some given constraints, based on the engineering problem statement. The other challenge is based on providing a model which is appealing to the eye based on the given theme. These models are then further subjected to stress tests, bending tests, and motion studies. ;1,,,,,
events;Seek the Leak;../data/events/seektheleak.jpg;As the names suggest the participants have to analyze a device that is losing energy continuously. The loss is causing the device to lose efficiency. So, the participants had to seek the source of the problem and offer feasible solutions for the same.;0,,,,,,,
events;Bridge Building;../data/events/woodbridge.jpg;The event required participants to use wooden blocks to create the most optimal platform which can hold maximum weight while at the same time using minimum material.;1,,,,,,,,
events;Lego Maker’s Event;../data/events/lego.jfif;This is one of the most fun events of the club. The participating candidates are given a basic  Lego set and are asked to build a structure out of it on their own or as per the given set of instructions. ;0,,,,,,,,
events;Robot Wars;../data/events/robowars.jpeg;Robot Wars was a several days long event conducted as a joint event alongside Junkyard Wars. As the name suggests, the event saw a battleground of robots where participants had to create robots and win battles against their opponent’s Robots. However, Robot Wars has been stopped for quite some time due to the online semester and dangers associated with robot wars.;1,,,,,,
events;Case Studies;../data/events/casestudy.jpg;Several case study events have been conducted by the Yantrik club. Some revolved around finding the cause of failure while some involved just general research on the given theme to solve the challenge.
